    The main process in which this launcher is invoked creates N so-called worker processes (using
    :func:`torch.multiprocessing.start_processes`) that run the given function.
    Worker processes have a rank that ranges from 0 to N - 1.

    Note:
        - This launcher requires all objects to be pickleable.
        - It is important that the entry point to the program/script is guarded by ``if __name__ == "__main__"``.
        - With start method 'fork' the user must ensure that no MUSA context gets created in the main process before
          the launcher is invoked. E.g., one should avoid creating musa tensors or calling ``torch.musa.*`` functions
          before calling ``Trainer.fit``.

    Args:
        strategy: A reference to the strategy that is used together with this launcher.
        start_method: The method how to start the processes.
            - 'spawn': The default start method. Requires all objects to be pickleable.
            - 'fork': Preferrable for IPython/Jupyter environments where 'spawn' is not available. Not available on
              the Windows platform for example.
            - 'forkserver': Alternative implementation to 'fork'.
