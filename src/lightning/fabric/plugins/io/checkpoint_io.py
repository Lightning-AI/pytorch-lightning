    """Interface to save/load checkpoints as they are saved through the ``Strategy``.

    .. warning::  This is an :ref:`experimental <versioning:Experimental API>` feature.

    Typically most plugins either use the Torch based IO Plugin; ``TorchCheckpointIO`` but may
    require particular handling depending on the plugin.

    In addition, you can pass a custom ``CheckpointIO`` by extending this class and passing it
    to the Trainer, i.e ``Trainer(plugins=[MyCustomCheckpointIO()])``.

    .. note::

        For some plugins, it is not possible to use a custom checkpoint plugin as checkpointing logic is not
        modifiable.
