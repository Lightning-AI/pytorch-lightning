## Lightning apps is simply organized Python

Lightning is a distributed, modular, free, and open framework for building all AI applications where the components you want, interact together. The concept of Lightning apps was designed to help you focus on the what you care about, and automate the rest. The Lightning framework can be used for any type of AI app, from a simple demo to a production pipeline. We encourage you to either try to migrate your existing workflows to Lightning and try to enhance them with other features and functionalities that will allow you to streamline your development process and share your AI apps!

We are looking forward to getting your feedback and improving the Lightning apps experience!

# Getting started

## Sign up

Sign up to [lightning.ai](http://lightning.ai) **with your GitHub account** (Google isn’t yet supported)

## Install

```
pip install -U lightning
```

## Build!

1. [Read this guide](https://ideal-potato-417c066a.pages.github.io/lightning_apps_intro.html) to install the framework and run your first app.
1. Time to get creative! Build your own app with the built-in components, or build your own components!

## Known Issues

• Please use Chrome, other browsers might have usability issues.

• Login via Google isn’t supported yet.

• Apps might take longer than expected to run.

• Hardware can only be specified via the framework.

• Work failures might not fail the app
