Training models with billions of parameters
###########################################

Today, large models with billions of parameters are trained with many GPUs across several machines in parallel.
Even a single H100 GPU with 80 GB of VRAM (one of the biggest today) is not enough to train just a 30B parameter model (even with batch size 1 and 16-bit precision).
The memory consumption for training is generally made up of

1. the model parameters,
2. the layer activations (forward),
3. the gradients (backward),
4. the optimizer states (e.g., Adam has two additional exponential averages per parameter) and
5. model outputs and loss.

When the sum of these memory components exceed the VRAM of a single GPU, regular data-parallel training (DDP) can no longer be employed.
To alleviate this limitation, we need to introduce **Model Parallelism**.

**************************
What is Model Parallelism?
**************************

There are different types of model parallelism, each with its own trade-offs.

**Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP)** shards both model parameters and optimizer states across multiple GPUs, significantly reducing memory usage per GPU.
This method, while highly memory-efficient, involves frequent synchronization between GPUs, introducing communication overhead and complexity in implementation.
FSDP is advantageous when memory constraints are the primary issue, provided there are high-bandwidth interconnects to minimize latency.

**Tensor Parallelism (TP)** splits individual tensors across GPUs, enabling fine-grained distribution of computation and memory.
It scales well to a large number of GPUs but requires synchronization of tensor slices after each operation, which adds communication overhead.
TP is most effective with models that have many linear layers (LLMs), offering a balance between memory distribution and computational efficiency.

**Pipeline Parallelism (PP)** divides model layers into segments, each processed by different GPUs, reducing memory load per GPU and minimizing inter-GPU communication to pipeline stage boundaries.
While this reduces communication overhead, it can introduce pipeline bubbles where some GPUs idle, leading to potential inefficiencies.
PP is ideal for deep models with sequential architectures (LLMs), though it requires careful management to minimize idle times.

Choosing a model parallelism style involves considering model architecture, hardware interconnects, and training efficiency.
In practice, hybrid approaches combining FSDP, TP, and PP are often used to leverage the strengths of each method while mitigating their weaknesses.

PyTorch Lightning supports all the parallelisms mentioned above natively through PyTorch, with the exception of pipeline parallelism (PP) which is not yet supported.
