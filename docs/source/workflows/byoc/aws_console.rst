1.1- Create a role
------------------

The created role will give Lightning AI access (by specifying Ligthning account id), and will

1. Sign in to your AWS account. (If you don’t have an AWS account, create one).

2. On AWS console search for IAM > Roles > Create role.

	In your new role set the following:

	* Trusted entity type -> AWS account.

	* An AWS account -> Another AWS account -> Account id: 748115360335. (This is Lightning's account id).

3. Protect your role by creating a hard to guess password that will be used to authenticate Lightning (You will need to pass it to Lightning for authnetication).

	* Set Require external ID: <put-your-hard-to-guess-token>

4. Click "Next"


1.2- Create a policy
--------------------

1. Click "Create policy" -> A new tab opens to the Create policy page.

2. Click the JSON tab and copy-paste the `contents of this JSON file <https://gist.github.com/rlizzo/4f36f64cf66fbe662ea6802f842b0433>` into the JSON workspace.

.. note: Ignore the warnings generated by AWS.

3. Click "Next:Tags" (you can skip this step)

4. Complete policy creation by adding a meaningful name and description to the policy.

	For example:

	Name -> "lightning-cloud"

	Description -> "permission to manage EC2 instances"

5. Add policy to the role: Return to the browser tab that you were using to create a role.
Refresh the policy list and select the custom policy you just created (in this case “lai-byoc-policy”). The policy should appear at the top of the Policy List.

6. Click "Next".

7. Provide a meaningful name and description for the role, and click “Create Role”.

	For example:

	Name -> "lightning-cloud"

	Description -> "Role for Lightning cloud permissions"

Congrats! You now successfully added the set up permissions needed for lightning to create a cluster.
