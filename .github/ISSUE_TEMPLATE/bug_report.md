## 🐛 Bug

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

### To Reproduce

Before reporting a bug, make sure that the bug can be reproduced with a minimal example. You can simply subclass our [miminal code example] (https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/master/pl_examples/bug_report_model.py) and add your relevant changes, to see if the issue persists. 
If the test is failing, please add your test cases to the issue (as a draft PR, or simple paste the code to the isse description here).

<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well -->


#### Code sample
<!-- Ideally attach a minimal code sample to reproduce the decried issue. 
Minimal means having the shortest code but still preserving the bug. -->

### Expected behavior
