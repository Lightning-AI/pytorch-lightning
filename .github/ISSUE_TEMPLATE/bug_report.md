## 🐛 Bug

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

### To Reproduce

<!--
Please reproduce using the BoringModel!

You can use the following Colab link:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/PytorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/master/pl_examples/bug_report/The_BoringModel.ipynb
IMPORTANT: has to be public.

or this simple template:
https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/blob/master/pl_examples/bug_report_model.py

If you could not reproduce using the BoringModel and still think there's a bug, please post here
but remember, bugs with code are fixed faster!
