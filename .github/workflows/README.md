| .azure-pipelines/gpu-benchmarks.yml    | Run speed/memory benchmarks for parity with vanila PyTorch.                               | GPU         |
| .github/workflows/ci-flagship-apps.yml | Run end-2-end tests with full applications, including deployment to the production cloud. | CPU         |
| .github/workflows/ci-tests-pytorch.yml | Run all tests except for accelerator-specific, standalone and slow tests.                 | CPU         |
| .github/workflows/tpu-tests.yml        | Run only TPU-specific tests. Requires that the PR title contains '[TPU]'                  | TPU         |

\* Each standalone test needs to be run in separate processes to avoid unwanted interactions between test cases.

- Accelerators used in CI

  - GPU: 2 x NVIDIA RTX 3090
  - TPU: [Google TPU v4-8](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs)

- To check which versions of Python or PyTorch are used for testing in our CI, see the corresponding workflow files or checkgroup config file at [`.github/checkgroup.yml`](../checkgroup.yml).
